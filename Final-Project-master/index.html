    <h1>The Best Video Games From 2015 to Today</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> After playing dozens of video games over the past few years, I have come up with a conclusion for the best video games since 2015. Even though thousands of video games have been produced since 2015, only some are worth even playing. Despite the numerous amount of awful video games, there have been a few which exceeded my expectations. After playing many of the most popular games, I think that I have come up with a conclusion on the best video games since 2015 varying from RPG's to FPS games across all platforms.</p>

    <h2>6.Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
    <p> This game started out as a FPS game with mountains full of bugs and glitches created by one of the biggest video game companies, Ubisoft. Despite the numerous bugs, Ubisoft decided to not trash the game completely, but to restore it. This game made one of the biggest comebacks in history, since now it has over 40 million active players worldwide. This skill based FPS is also based on strategy, where players are able to get creative with their strategies to win. On most games, even FPS games, I ussually don't play past 100 hours, bu I have well over 800 on this game. There's something about this game that just makes players want to play it even more, to try out new strategies or to just try to win a game. This game has over 50 different and unique operators that players can play as. Despite some obvious issues such as server lag or occassionally bad matchmaking, this game has become the top 5 most played game on PC.</p>

This game mainly focuses on the main character, Kratos and his relationship with his son. They begin their adventure when Kratos’s wife dies and to carry out her wishes.

Starting the game, you are able to enjoy Hyrule, all of the land, puzzles and enemies. This game is extremely well executed, despite the occasional lag in the forest. Link also needs survival stuff, such as food, clothes and gear. This game allows players to interact with almost everything, such as puzzles, trees or terrains. Each terrain has a different ecosystem, and you as a player need to learn them. </p>

    <h2>2.Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
    <p> First of all, this game has amazing graphics. Due to the new 4k PS4 Pro, Red Dead Redemption looks stunning absolutely on the TV. The gameplay itself is extremely immersive, with almost 50 hours of gameplay. Each quest is unique and the side quests are filled with story. Every single thing, from tiny animals to humans are interactions. Players are able to explore the massive world and interact with basically anything, such as player poker in a bar or taming wild animals. Even the smallest characters are given lots of attention, based on their personalities, clothes and actions. This game is quite exceptional, but it lacks consistency of action and story telling. </p>

    <h2>1.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
